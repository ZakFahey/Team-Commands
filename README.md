Are you bothered by manually having to give people an item or teleport them? This plugin removes this inconvenience by giving you a set of commands to do things in the vanilla TShock server to an entire team.

$ Commands:
Many of these are similar to the general TShock command, so descriptions aren't really necessary for the most part. Aliases work. The team argument takes red, green, yellow, blue, white/none, and all. Anything else will return the team you're currently on. Each command uses the same permission as its regular TShock counterpart. So for example, you could type /team kill red to kill of the entire red team.

/team help [pagenumber] - Shows all team commands.
/team kick <team> [reason]
/team ban <team> [reason] - The same as /ban add
/team tempban <team> <time> [reason] - The same as /ban addtemp
/team mute <team> [reason] - Unlike the original, this and the command below either mute or unmute all players instead of toggling it.
/team unmute <team>
/team tempgroup <team> <new group>
/team usergroup <team> <new group> - The same as /user group
/team give <item type/id> <team> [item amount] [prefix id/name]
/team tphere <team>
/team gbuff <team> <buff id/name> [time(seconds)]
/team heal <team>
/team kill <team>
/team slap <team> [damage]
/team who <team> [pagenumber] - Shows all players on a certain team.
/team sendwarp <team> <warpname> - The same as /warp send
